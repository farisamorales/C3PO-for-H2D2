Emissivity tables are formatted as a matrix with row indicies of grain sizes and column indicies of wavelengths.
The top most row is the wavelengths (in microns).
The left most column is the grain radius (in microns).

To read-in these tables use the following:
--------------------------------------------------
def readEmiss(FILE):
	from kmod import listifier, whiteSpaceParser
	FILE.seek(0)
	Wavelengths = listifier(whiteSpaceParser(FILE.readline()))
	GrainRadii, Emissivities = [], []
	for ele in FILE:
		temp = listifier(whiteSpaceParser(ele))
		Emissivities.append(temp[1:])
		GrainRadii.append(temp[0])
	return Wavelengths, GrainRadii, Emissivities
--------------------------------------------------
Wavelengths is a list of the wavelengths
GrainRadii is a list of the grain radii
Emissivities is a list of lists consisting of the emissivities; the interior lists are by wavelength; the exterior list by grain radii
For example, suppose the grain radius of 1.0 is associated with the index 78 and the wavelength of 31.4 with the index 90, then to
get the emissivity for that grainsize for light of that wavelength you would call Emissivities[78][90].
The interior and exterior indicies for a given grain radii and light wavelength are identical to those is there own lists.
