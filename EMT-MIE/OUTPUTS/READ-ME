READ ME!
Emissivity tables are formatted as a matrix with row indicies of grain sizes and column indicies of wavelengths.
The top most row is the wavelengths (in microns).
The left most column is the grain radius (in microns).

To read-in these tables use the following:
--------------------------------------------------
from kmod import listifier, whiteSpaceParser
def readEmiss(FILE):
	FILE.seek(0)
	Lamda = listifier(whiteSpaceParser(FILE.readline()))
	Emiss = []
	for ele in FILE:
		temp = listifier(whiteSpaceParser(ele))
		Emiss.append(temp)
	return Lamda, Emiss
--------------------------------------------------
Lamda is a list of the wavelengths
Emiss is a list of lists consisting of the emissivities; the interior lists are by wavelength; the exterior list by grain radii
The first element in the interior list (index 0) is the grain radius associated with those emissivities.
The index position of the emissivities in the interior lists associated with a wavelength in the wavelength list of index n is n+1;
That is, if 1.0 micron has the index 7, then in the interior lists, the emissivities associated with 1.0 micron have index 8
